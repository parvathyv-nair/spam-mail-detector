Spam Email Detector Project
A Spam Email Detector is a great intermediate project to work on. You can use Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and a machine learning model to classify emails as spam or not spam (also called "ham"). Below, I'll provide you with a Python implementation for a spam email detector.



To build this project, you'll need:
Python installed on your system.
The following Python libraries:
pandas for data manipulation.
sklearn for machine learning and NLP.
nltk for text preprocessing.


You can install the required libraries using pip:
pip install pandas scikit-learn nltk


Dataset
For this project, we'll use the SMS Spam Collection Dataset, which is publicly available and contains labeled spam and ham messages.
